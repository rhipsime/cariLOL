# cariLOL

## A program that allows the user to enter culinary keywords and obtain fun, exotic and random recipes from around the world! On the other hand, it also allows users to get their BMI.

This project was carried out to create 2 apps, linked in one website:

1) An app that allows the user to enter a few keywords and obtain detailed recipes on how to prepare those meals. The app allows the user to determine the portion size (by weight) of a given food/group of foods and to get the basic nutritional value for it/them. At the same time, the app produces 3 ramdom recipes where the ingredients entered by the user are prevalent. These recipes are presented as images and links for the detailed instructions for the preparation of the meals.

2) An app that takes the user's basic physiological details and returns their BMI.
